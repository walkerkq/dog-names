# Exploring the Relationship Between Dog Names and Breeds 

How much does breed influence a dog's name?

Do you meet more Beagles than Bulldogs named "Bailey"? Fewer Pugs and more Dachshunds named "Nathan"?

The physical characteristics and personality traits associated with each breed probably make a bigger impact on your dog's name than you think. (Why didn't you consider "Gizmo" for your German Shepherd?)

In 2013, WNYC published an extensive dataset of dogs in New York City as part of their [Dogs of NYC project](https://project.wnyc.org/dogs-of-nyc/). The [dataset](https://fusiontables.google.com/data?docid=1pKcxc8kzJbBVzLu_kgzoAMzqYhZyUhtScXjB0BQ#rows:id=1) includes the name, gender, breed, color and borough of more than 50,000 dogs.
